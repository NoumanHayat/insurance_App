<!-- 
User Stories are the standard method of documenting requirements for Agile Projects and form the interface through which Developers and the other members of the Scrum Team communicate.

User Stories document the individual actions that a specific user or type of user should be able to perform, and the benefit that the user is expecting to gain from the successful performance of that action. They have a strict format and are careful to specify a single action, from the perspective of a single user\user type and stay away from specifying design.

Please follow the instructions in each of the sections below, adhering to the template and replacing the placeholder text as you go.

NB. This is a template and sections can be filled or left as is where information is or is not available, or sections are or are not relevant.

Please replace the braces {{  }} and the text between, being careful not to suggest or specify any kind of design or implementation.

 As a {{ User \ User Group }},

 I would like the ability to {{ action to be performed by the user\user group }},

 So that I may {{ value to be gained through the successful performance of the action being described  }}.

 # Acceptance Criteria
 <!--
    Please provide a task list of statements that are measurable, concise and directly related to the completion of the action being described and the value to be gained from its completion.
    
    Acceptance Criteria should seek to answer the questions:
        1. How do we know when the action has been completed successfully?
        2. How do we know when the action has been completed unsuccessfully?
        3. How do we know when the action has not been completed successfully?
