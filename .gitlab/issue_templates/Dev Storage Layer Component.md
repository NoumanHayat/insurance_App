<!--
    Storage Layer issues define the tasks that need to be completed, within the Storage Layer of an application to support a user story. Each Storage Layer Task should describe a single object\entity within the storage layer. 

    Please follow the instructions in each of the sections below, adhering to the template and replacing the placeholder text as you go.

    NB. This is a template and sections can be filled or left as is where information is or is not available, or sections are or are not relevant.

    Please replace the braces {{  }} and the text between.
   
    Please provide a definition of the storage layer entity, this definition should provide context to the developer about what, real world, object\entity it represents and gives information about what attributes need to be captured. This definition should be detailed, but concise and should describe only one object\entity.

# Design
<!-- 
    The designs for Storage Layer tasks may differ depending on the architecture of the storage layer of the application and where in that architecture the object\entity is to be implemented.

    In the context of a relational database, designs may be listed as links to the typical design documents for this kind of model, Entity Relationship Diagrams and Relational Notation, for example. These documents should be centrally stored\hosted, so that they may be maintained in a single place.

    In the context of a NoSQL database, whether simple key value pairing or document model; designs should be noted directly on the task in the most appropriate form. This will typically be JSON, which effectively communicates object structure, attributes and the datatypes of those attributes. This notation, must effectively communicate data types and only include example values where absolutely necessary, for example if these values are generated by a third party system and may impact datatype or filtering and validation.

# Checklist
<!-- 
    The Checklist section of each implementation issue is designed to allow a Senior to specify a number of specific implementation requirements for the issue in question. It exists as a task list to be checked off during code review to validate that the code produced meets the specific requirements of the component documented in the issue.
 -->

## Implementation
 - [ ] Is a database population script entry present to show a sample of how the data would be inserted into the database?
 - [ ] Is the population script still able to properly execute?

## Relationships
 - [ ] Does the entity have all the valid relationships to other entities it could have?

## Readabiltiy
 - [ ] Are previous attribute naming conventions being respected? (eg. If `date_start` is being used in other entities, this entity should not name its attribute `start_date`, `camelCasing` maintained, `snake_casing` maintained, etc.)
 - [ ] Are the attribute names easy to understand?
