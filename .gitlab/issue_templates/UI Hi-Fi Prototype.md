 -->
 - [ ] [Figma UI]()
 - [ ] [Figma Prototype Page]()
 - [ ] Update Wiki [Feature Page with Prototype URL]()
 - [ ] Create matching ~"Type::presentation" issue for Frontend Development
 - [ ] Reviewed and Approved in Design Team Acceptance Meeting

 ### Components
 - [ ] 98% of elements are components
 - [ ] Components and their elements are consistent
     - [ ] No unintentional -x -y shifting from frame-to-frame
     - [ ] No unintentional color changes
     - [ ] No unintentional font-style changes
     - [ ] No missing text

### Interaction
 - [ ] Actions are tied to the correct resulting frame/component
 - [ ] Go back to / clear a previous action using elements in-frame
 - [ ] Ability to type input into text fields
 - [ ] Hover-style / Cursor-style over action buttons, links and fields
 - [ ] All buttons function in all frames (redirect, minimize, etc)
 - [ ] Horizontal Scroll functional where necessary
 - [ ] Vertical Scroll functional where necessary
 - [ ] Planned action matches outcome
 - [ ] Updates to elements reflect the action of the tester (navigation, progress bars, submissions, etc)

 ### Transition & Animation
 - [ ] Related to causing action & general UI theme
 - [ ] Easing, Cubic-Bezier Curve & Motion Blur considered
 - [ ] General speed: <=250-300ms, unless motion is more involved
 - [ ] List / Array speed: 20-25 ms
 - [ ] Scaling of elements affect speed
 - [ ] Equal interaction: animation of all main-component duplicates & those of its type obey the same rules.
 - [ ] During movement, objects don't pass through each other
 - [ ] Proportional change of the size is fulfilled in a straight line
 - [ ] Imported GIFs used where necessary; no stills unless photos/illustrations/vectors
 

### Affordance / Context 
 - [ ] The function of the control is easily determined at a glance
 - [ ] The users current location is easy to assess
 - [ ] Hit areas for buttons and other interactive elements are not too small
